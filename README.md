We will use some **datasets** from [this course](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS/tree/master/data).

## Set-up
**See a more detailed [guide to setup your environment](setup.md), with multiple options.**

### Editor

You will need an **editor** to write code and edit files. If you don't have a preferred one yet, check [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks

* Option 0 (fallback): Use [Binder](https://mybinder.org) (link above). Keep in mind you need to download your notebooks to save them locally. (Note: Binder )

* Option 1 (recommended): Download [the repository contents](https://github.com/uvacreate/2021-coding-the-humanities) and use Jyputer Notebook. See the [guide to setup your environment](setup.md) for more info.

* Option 2 (advanced): work directly with git and conda. See the [guide to setup your environment](setup.md) for more info.
